## ðŸ”¨ Architecture
First of all, I used Clean Architecture, to learn some architecture that is used in the real world, so I donâ€™t know a lot of architecture yet. However, I will try to explain why is Clean Architecture in this project.

1. The code is more testable than other architectures like MVC (Model - View - Controller).

2. The project is separated into layers that have one purpose. Therefore, itâ€™s easy to navigate between them, and if I have something to do with the database, I know that I have to go to the Data Layer, or if I have to fix some business rule, I go to the Use Case layer, and so onâ€¦

3. When the project is already structured is easy to implement a new feature, since everything is separated, we donâ€™t have to worry if we are going to break something that has nothing to do with the new feature. Of course, itâ€™s not impossible to do that but itâ€™s not frequent as other architectures.

4. If the project needs to change some dependencies, the process to do that is going to be easier, since the layers donâ€™t affect each other. For example, in this project, Iâ€™m using [dayjs](src/shared/container/providers/DateProvider/implementations/DayjsDateProvider.ts) to compare dates in days, hours, and so onâ€¦ If the project needs to change this lib to [date-fns](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns), what I have to do is create a new class called `DatefnsDateProvider` that implements the interface [IDateProvider](src/shared/container/providers/DateProvider/IDateProvider.ts) that have all methods needed for the project, I implement those methods using date-fns, I register a singleton (in this [file](src/shared/container/providers/index.ts)) for the `DatefnsDateProvider` like this: 

```ts
...
container.registerSingleton<IDateProvider>(
  "DayjsDateProvider",
  DayjsDateProvider
);

container.registerSingleton<IDateProvider>(
  "DatefnsDateProvider",
  DatefnsDateProvider
);
...
```

and then start to immigrate all the inject of DayjsDateProvider to `DatefnsDateProvider`. For example, in the CreateRentalUseCase:

```typescript
...
@injectable()
class CreateRentalUseCase {
  constructor(
    @inject("RentalsRepository")
    private rentalsRepository: IRentalsRepository,
    @inject("DayjsDateProvider") // Here would be like @inject("DatefnsDateProvider")
    private dateProvider: IDateProvider,
...
```
